#####basic keywords
JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive.

JavaScript can run in browsers and on servers using Node.js.

JavaScript is commonly used to build web applications with libraries like React.

JavaScript variables can be declared using var, let, and const.

var, let, and const are not data types; they are keywords used to declare variables.

The main data types in JavaScript include string, number, boolean, null, undefined, object, and array.

var is function-scoped, meaning it is accessible anywhere inside the function where it is declared.

var does not follow block scope and can be accessed outside blocks like if, for, and while.

Variables declared with var are not accessible outside the function in which they are declared.

let and const are block-scoped, meaning they are accessible only within the block where they are declared.

Variables declared with let can be reassigned, while variables declared with const cannot be reassigned.

Variables declared in the global scope can be accessed inside functions.

Variables declared inside a function cannot be accessed outside that function.

In modern JavaScript, let and const should be preferred over var.

The use of var is discouraged in new code because it can cause unexpected behavior due to its scoping rules.



#####JavaScript Hoisting – Things to Remember (Notes)

Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during execution.

Variables declared with var are hoisted and initialized with undefined.

Variables declared with let and const are hoisted but are not initialized, so accessing them before declaration causes an error.

Accessing a var variable before its declaration does not throw an error but returns undefined.

Accessing a let or const variable before its declaration results in a ReferenceError due to the temporal dead zone.

Hoisting behavior is another reason why var is discouraged in modern JavaScript.


#########javascript functions

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

Functions help organize code and reduce repetition.

A function can take inputs called parameters and can return a value using the return keyword.

Calling a function executes the code inside the function.

Assigning a function to a variable stores the function definition, not the function’s return value.

The return value of a function is produced only when the function is called.

The return value must be stored in a variable or used directly; otherwise, it is lost.

Functions create their own scope, and variables declared inside a function are not accessible outside it
